# Uppercaser Client

A simple web-based client for consuming the Uppercaser service

## Usage

Bootstrapped with vite. You can locally develop the client by itself using the vite dev server, but it is configured to proxy `/api/*` requests to a `localhost` server running on a different port. Use the development script in the root directory to launch a complete development environment.

Install dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

Run the development server

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build a production bundle

```sh
npm run build
```
